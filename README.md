# RayTracingRenderer
A C++ raytracing renderer based on Peter Shirley's tutorial.

In this renderer, the camera is facing -Z by default, +Y goes up in image and +X goes right in image.
The coordination system is right-handed.
The output image is in PPM format.

command line: build\main.exe > image.ppm
